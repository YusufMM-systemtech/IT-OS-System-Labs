A complete technical lab demonstrating how to install, configure, and manage 
two operating systems (Windows 10 and Windows 8) on a single machine using 
Oracle VirtualBox. This project includes OS installation, manual disk partitioning,
dual-boot configuration, and creation of a shared NTFS user-data volume, based on 
a college-level multi-OS deployment lab.
